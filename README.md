# UdayPhanindra_Yarlagadda_Teladoc_Challenge

I have solved this challenge by making use of Firefox with Python and Selenium.

Please install Geckodriver with version 0.24.0 and firefox with version 60.6.1
Once you have installed the above, you can just run python code.py which will add a user and also delete a user.
