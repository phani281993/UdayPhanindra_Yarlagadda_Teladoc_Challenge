# UdayPhanindra_Yarlagadda_Teladoc_Challenge

Please install Geckodriver with version 0.24.0 and firefox with version 60.6.1

I have solved this challenge by making use of Firefox with Python and Selenium.

Once you have installed the above, you can just run python code.py which will add a user and also delete a user.
